# üîê Activities Ownership Migration Guide

## Overview
This migration adds proper ownership controls to the `activities` table, ensuring users can only see and manage their own activities while allowing admins to see all activities.

## What This Migration Does

### 1. **Schema Updates**
- Updates foreign key from `accounts` to `businesses` table
- Backfills `created_by` column from business owners
- Adds performance indexes

### 2. **Automatic Ownership Assignment**
- Creates triggers that automatically set `created_by` when new activities are created
- Ensures all activities have proper ownership

### 3. **Security (RLS)**
- Owners can only read/write their own activities
- Admins can read all activities
- Prevents unauthorized access

### 4. **Performance**
- Adds indexes for fast filtering by `created_by` and `created_at`

## How to Apply the Migration

### Step 1: Open the Migration Helper
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000/apply-migration.html`
3. Log in to your Supabase account

### Step 2: Check Current State
1. Click "Check Current State" to verify database access
2. Ensure you can see activities, businesses, and accounts data

### Step 3: Apply the SQL Migration
1. Click "Show Migration SQL" to see the complete SQL
2. Copy the SQL code
3. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
4. Paste and run the SQL migration
5. Wait for it to complete successfully

### Step 4: Verify the Migration
1. Go back to the migration helper
2. Click "Verify Migration" to test that everything works
3. Click "Test Activities" to ensure functionality

## Testing the Migration

### Quick Console Test
After applying the migration, test in your browser console:

```javascript
// Test activities query
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
await supabase
  .from('activities')
  .select('id,created_at,created_by')
  .eq('created_by', user.id)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1);
```

### Test File
Open `http://localhost:3000/test-activities-ownership.html` for comprehensive testing.

## What to Expect

### Before Migration
- Activities might not have proper `created_by` values
- Users might see activities they shouldn't
- No automatic ownership assignment

### After Migration
- All activities have proper `created_by` values
- Users only see their own activities
- New activities automatically get correct ownership
- Admins can see all activities
- Better performance with indexes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Foreign key constraint" error**
   - Make sure the `businesses` table exists and has data
   - Check that `activities.business_id` values match `businesses.id`

2. **"Permission denied" error**
   - Ensure you're logged in as a user with proper permissions
   - Check that RLS policies are correctly applied

3. **"created_by is null" after migration**
   - Run the backfill query manually:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.activities a
   SET created_by = b.owner_user_id
   FROM public.accounts b
   WHERE a.business_id = b.id AND a.created_by IS NULL;
   ```

### Rollback (if needed)
If you need to rollback the migration:

```sql
-- Remove triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_activities_set_owner_ins ON public.activities;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_activities_set_owner_upd ON public.activities;

-- Remove policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "owner or admin read activities" ON public.activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "owner insert activities" ON public.activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "owner update activities" ON public.activities;

-- Remove indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_activities_created_by;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_activities_created_at;

-- Remove function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.set_activity_owner();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.is_admin(uuid);
```

## Frontend Compatibility

The frontend code in `owner-activities.js` already works correctly with this migration:
- ‚úÖ Filters by `created_by` (line 62)
- ‚úÖ Uses proper query structure
- ‚úÖ Handles insert/update/delete operations

No frontend changes are needed!

## Next Steps

After successful migration:
1. Test the activities functionality in your app
2. Monitor query performance
3. Consider adding more admin features if needed
4. Update any documentation about activities ownership

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Verify the migration completed successfully
3. Test with the provided test files
4. Check that your user has proper permissions
