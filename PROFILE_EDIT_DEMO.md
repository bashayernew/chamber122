# ‚úÖ Profile Editing & Gallery Upload - FIXED

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Profile details don't show after editing
**Root Cause:** Profile page was showing hardcoded placeholders instead of fetching real data from database

**Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Added `loadBusinessData()` function that fetches from `businesses` table
- ‚úÖ Displays actual: `name`, `short_description`, `logo_url`, etc.
- ‚úÖ Updates UI with real business information

### 2. ‚ùå No profile editing form
**Root Cause:** Profile page had no way to edit business details

**Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Added "Edit Profile" button
- ‚úÖ Added edit form with fields: Business Name, Description, Logo URL
- ‚úÖ Added save functionality that updates database
- ‚úÖ Shows character counter for description (200 max)

### 3. ‚ùå Gallery uploads don't update profile
**Root Cause:** No refresh mechanism after image upload

**Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Gallery upload now triggers `window.refreshProfile()`
- ‚úÖ Profile data reloads after successful upload
- ‚úÖ Toast notification shows "Profile refreshed"

## Technical Details

### Database Updates

**Profile Edit saves to:**
```sql
UPDATE businesses 
SET name = $1, 
    short_description = $2,
