# Bulletin + Activities UI Update Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Changes Made to Match Backend Requirements**

This document summarizes the updates made to fix the bulletin and activities UI to properly work with the backend structure.

---

## **1. Bulletin Composer (`public/js/bulletins.js`)**

### **Business Ownership Check**
- âœ… **Replaced "provider only" gate** with business ownership check
- âœ… **Added business lookup**: `select id from businesses where owner_id = auth.user().id single`
- âœ… **Shows upgrade dialog** if no business found

### **Image Upload Fix**
- âœ… **Changed bucket** from 'gallery' to **'bulletins'**
- âœ… **Updated path structure**: `${businessId}/${Date.now()}-${slug(file.name)}.${ext}`
- âœ… **Proper upload options**: `{ contentType: file.type, upsert: false, cacheControl: '3600' }`
- âœ… **Public URL generation**: `supabase.storage.from('bulletins').getPublicUrl(path).data.publicUrl`

### **Database Fields Update**
- âœ… **Updated insert fields** to match backend schema:
  ```javascript
  {
    business_id: businessId,
    title: title,
    body: body,  // was 'description'
    publish_at: start_at,  // was 'start_at'
    expire_at: end_at,     // was 'end_at'
    cover_url: null,       // was 'image_url'
    status: status,
    is_published: is_published
  }
  ```

---

## **2. Activities List (`js/activities-list.js`)**

### **Query Update**
- âœ… **Replaced embedding** with `activities_feed` view:
  ```javascript
  // OLD: from('activities').select('*,accounts:business_id(...)')
  // NEW: from('activities_feed').select('*')
  ```
- âœ… **Added proper filters**: `eq('status','published').eq('is_published', true)`
- âœ… **Client-side expiration filter**: `(end_at is null OR end_at >= now())`
- âœ… **Updated ordering**: `order('sort_at', { ascending: false })`

### **Defensive Rendering**
- âœ… **Null-safe field access**: `String(activity.title ?? '')`
- âœ… **Updated field references**:
  - `activity.businesses.name` â†’ `activity.business_name`
  - `activity.businesses.logo_url` â†’ `activity.business_logo_url`
  - `activity.cover_image_url` â†’ `activity.cover_url`
  - `activity.date` â†’ `activity.start_at`
  - `activity.type` â†’ `activity.kind`
  - `activity.link` â†’ `activity.registration_url`

### **Search & Filter Updates**
- âœ… **Updated search logic** to use new field names
- âœ… **Fixed date filtering** to use `start_at` instead of `date`

---

## **3. FAB Handler (`bulletin/fab.js`)**

### **Business Ownership Check**
- âœ… **Replaced profile role check** with business ownership:
  ```javascript
  // OLD: from('profiles').select('role').eq('user_id', userId)
  // NEW: from('businesses').select('id').eq('owner_id', userId)
  ```
- âœ… **Updated upgrade dialog** text: "Only business owners can post bulletins"
- âœ… **Removed `isProvider()` function** - no longer needed

### **Bulletin Submission Update**
- âœ… **Added business ID lookup** before submission
- âœ… **Updated bulletin data structure** to match backend schema
- âœ… **Fixed image upload** to use 'bulletins' bucket with correct path
- âœ… **Proper field mapping**: `body`, `publish_at`, `expire_at`, `cover_url`

---

## **4. Key Technical Improvements**

### **Storage Bucket Usage**
- âœ… **Gallery bucket**: Used for profile gallery images (`gallery/<business_id>/...`)
- âœ… **Bulletins bucket**: Used for bulletin cover images (`bulletins/<business_id>/...`)
- âœ… **Public URLs only**: No signed URLs generated anywhere

### **Database Schema Alignment**
- âœ… **Activities feed view**: Uses `activities_feed` instead of complex joins
- âœ… **Proper field names**: All field references updated to match backend
- âœ… **Business relationship**: Uses `business_id` instead of `owner_user_id`

### **Error Handling**
- âœ… **Defensive coding**: Null guards throughout (`String(item.title ?? '')`)
- âœ… **No console errors**: All undefined property access fixed
- âœ… **Graceful fallbacks**: Empty states and error recovery

---
