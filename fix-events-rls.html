        <h1>🔧 Fix Events RLS Policies</h1>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>🚨 ISSUE:</strong> The events table has RLS policies that are blocking public read access. This is why events aren't showing up on the events page.
        </div>

        <h3>Step 1: Copy and Run This SQL</h3>
        <p>Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run this:</p>
        
        <div class="sql-code">
-- Fix RLS policies for events table
-- Allow public read access to published events
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to published events" ON events
FOR SELECT USING (
  status = 'published' 
  AND is_published = true
);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert events
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert events" ON events
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Allow users to update their own events
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own events" ON events
FOR UPDATE USING (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' 
  AND business_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM businesses WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Allow users to delete their own events
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own events" ON events
FOR DELETE USING (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' 
  AND business_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM businesses WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
        </div>
        
        <button id="copySql" class="button">Copy SQL to Clipboard</button>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Alternative - Disable RLS Temporarily</h3>
        <p>If the above doesn't work, temporarily disable RLS on events table:</p>
        
        <div class="sql-code">
-- TEMPORARY: Disable RLS on events table
ALTER TABLE events DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        </div>
        
        <button id="copyDisable" class="button">Copy Disable RLS SQL</button>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Test</h3>
        <p>After running the SQL, test the events page:</p>
        
        <button id="testEvents" class="button">Open Events Page</button>
    </div>
