# Owner Gallery - Testing Guide

## üéØ **Gallery Functionality Test**

This guide will walk you through testing the Owner Gallery system to ensure image upload, display, and deletion work correctly.

### **Prerequisites**
- Supabase client is properly configured (`window.supabase` exists)
- You are signed in as a business owner
- Storage bucket "gallery" exists with public read enabled
- RLS policies allow owner to manage files under `gallery/<business_id>/*`

### **Test Flow Overview**
1. Navigate to owner profile page
2. Upload multiple images
3. Verify images appear instantly in grid
4. Test image deletion
5. Refresh page and verify persistence
6. Test error handling

## **Step 1: Access Gallery**

### **URL:** `/public/profile.html`

1. **Navigate to Profile**
   - Go to `/public/profile.html`
   - Verify you see the "Gallery" section
   - Verify you see "Upload Images" button
   - Verify gallery grid shows "No images yet" placeholder

### **Expected Result:**
- Gallery section is visible
- Upload button is present
- Empty state shows correctly

---

## **Step 2: Upload Images**

1. **Click Upload Button**
   - Click "Upload Images" button
   - File picker should open
   - Select multiple image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)

2. **Verify Upload Process**
   - Toast notifications should appear for each upload
   - Images should appear in grid immediately (optimistic updates)
   - Success toasts should show for each successful upload

3. **Test Different File Types**
   - Upload a JPG file ‚úÖ (should work)
   - Upload a PNG file ‚úÖ (should work)
   - Try to upload a PDF file ‚ùå (should show error toast)
   - Try to upload a very large file ‚ùå (should show error toast)

### **Expected Result:**
- Images upload successfully to `gallery/<business_id>/<timestamp>-<slug>.<ext>`
- Images appear instantly in grid
- Error handling works for invalid files
- Toast notifications provide feedback

---

## **Step 3: Verify Image Display**

1. **Check Grid Layout**
   - Images should be in responsive grid (1-4 columns based on screen size)
   - Each image should show as a card with hover effects
   - Images should have proper aspect ratio (h-48)

2. **Test Hover Effects**
   - Hover over an image card
   - Delete button should appear with fade-in effect
   - Card should have subtle border color change

3. **Check Image Loading**
   - Images should load with lazy loading
   - Fallback error image should show if image fails to load
   - Filename should be displayed below each image

### **Expected Result:**
- Responsive grid layout works correctly
- Hover effects are smooth and functional
- Images load properly with fallbacks

---

## **Step 4: Test Image Deletion**

1. **Delete Single Image**
   - Hover over an image to reveal delete button
   - Click "Delete" button
   - Confirm deletion in dialog
   - Image should disappear from grid immediately
   - Success toast should appear

2. **Delete Multiple Images**
   - Delete several images one by one
   - Each deletion should work independently
   - Grid should update correctly after each deletion

3. **Test Empty State**
   - Delete all images
   - Grid should show "No images yet" placeholder
   - Placeholder should have proper styling and icon

### **Expected Result:**
- Images delete successfully from storage
- UI updates immediately (optimistic updates)
- Empty state shows correctly when no images remain

---

## **Step 5: Test Persistence**

1. **Refresh Page**
   - Refresh the browser page
   - Gallery should reload and show all uploaded images
   - Images should persist from storage

2. **Verify Image URLs**
   - Right-click on images and "Open in new tab"
   - Images should load from public URLs (not signed URLs)
   - URLs should follow pattern: `https://<supabase-url>/storage/v1/object/public/gallery/<business_id>/<filename>`

### **Expected Result:**
- Images persist after page refresh
- Images load from public URLs
- No signed URLs are used

---

## **Step 6: Test Error Handling**

### **Test Network Errors**
1. Disconnect internet
2. Try to upload an image
3. Verify error toast appears
4. Reconnect internet and try again

### **Test File Validation**
1. Try to upload non-image files
2. Try to upload very large files (>10MB)
3. Verify appropriate error messages

### **Test Authentication**
1. Sign out and try to access gallery
2. Verify appropriate error message
3. Sign back in and verify gallery works

### **Expected Result:**
- All error scenarios handled gracefully
- Clear error messages shown to user
- No console errors or crashes

---

## **Step 7: Test Responsive Design**

1. **Desktop View**
   - Gallery should show 4 columns on large screens
   - Images should be properly sized

2. **Tablet View**
   - Gallery should show 2-3 columns on medium screens
   - Layout should be responsive

3. **Mobile View**
   - Gallery should show 1-2 columns on small screens
   - Upload button should be accessible
   - Touch interactions should work

### **Expected Result:**
- Responsive design works across all screen sizes
- Touch interactions work on mobile
- Layout adapts properly

### **Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify Supabase client is initialized
5. Check storage bucket permissions
